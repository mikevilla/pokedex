###  Pokedex Functionality
* This app makes use the Pokemon API to make API requests for data https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2. 
* Able to search for any Pokemon through the search bar or scanning on the index page
* Able to see a history of what has been searched and revisit at anytime via the recently searched list in the search bar and also a list of pokemon avatars that are shown once they have been visited.
* Able to see details about abilities, moves, species, sprites and types upon searching.
* Able to see other evolutions of Pokemon and be able to navigate to specific Pokemon in the evolution chain.

### Technical Notes
* This app was built using the latest React Framework currently 18.2.0
* Store is handled with the latest React-Redux and Redux Toolkit 
* Built with TypeScript 
* Styling the UI was built using some of the available components in the MUI V5 framework

### Testing
* JavaScript Testing Framework is handled with Jest unit tests files located in each component folder file for example Pokemon.test.tsx

### Available Scripts

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### Future Considerations and Feature Additions

* Implement Concurrency: To handle multiple requests simultaneously, you can use concurrency techniques like Goroutines (Go) or Threads (Python). This will allow you to provide a fast response time to clients even when the database is being accessed by multiple clients at the same time.


* Cache frequently requested data: To reduce the load on the database and improve performance, you can cache frequently requested data in memory. You can use a caching library like Redis for this.


* Test and Deploy: Finally, test the Pokédex thoroughly to ensure that it works as expected and can handle a high volume of requests. Once you are satisfied with the results, you can deploy the Pokédex to a server or a cloud environment.


* These are the basic steps to create a Pokédex in a concurrent environment. You may also want to add additional features like pagination, sorting, and filtering to the API to make it more user-friendly.
